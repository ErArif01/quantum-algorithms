## Shor's Algorithm:
      Shor's algorithm is famous for its ability to factor large numbers exponentially faster than the best-known classical algorithms. This has significant implications for cryptography, as many classical encryption methods rely on the difficulty of factoring large numbers
      for their security. Shor's algorithm threatens the security of widely used encryption schemes like RSA.


## Grover's Algorithm: 
       Grover's algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that can search an unsorted database quadratically faster than the best-known classical algorithms. In classical computing, an unsorted database would require, on average, searching half of the entries to find a specific items

       Grover's algorithm, however, can achieve this with only a square root of the classical search time, offering a quadratic speedup.
